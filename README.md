In this mini project we try to analyze data from TESLA stock using an open dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timoboz/tesla-stock-data-from-2010-to-2020).
Firstly, we take a look in data and then try to make a prediction of 'Close' stock using Linear Regression (using python)
In conclusion, we present the predicted values vs actual values and we figure out the differents.
